# Digital-Board-Game
Original Board game for 2 to 4 players

****FOR CONTEXT****
First and foremost, I have only uploaded this so that any recruiters/employers may examine this game that I have created. If you are not a recruiter/employer, or somebody I have personally invited to view this code, then 1) How on earth did you find this? 2) Please click away. I am not ready to release the game, although it is fully operational. Notice that I have not said that is complete in that I wrote this code before I started college as a way to teach myself python while also creating a passion project to play with friends and family. While it is not all bad, it certainly needs to be cleaned up, (there are a couple of global variables declared, for ex.). Nonetheless, the code works and I have played the game a countless amount of times. I will go back when I have the time to optimize it and make it adhere to conventions using my newfound coding knowledge from my education. I am very proud of this project, as unpolished as it may be, as it demonstrates that I know how to program an ambitious project from start to finish. 

Alrighty, with that out of the way, here's what you need to know about the game: 

To run, you will need to simply compile and run the Digital_Board_Game.py file and pygame will take care of the rest. For the record, I hav used the pygame library in python to make this, and it was sufficient to make the entire thing code-wise. You can ingore all of the other files as most of them are sprite animations for the 20 different units that are in the game. 

Once the game is running you will see this:
